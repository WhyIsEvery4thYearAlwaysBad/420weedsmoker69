Can y'all upgrade the tele when not doing anything?
-Fixed class specific menu not showing.
-Can now alert team of multiple sentries.
-Moved some binds to be set in a sensical order.
-Removed ÜBER script (Felt too annoying)
-Removed MVM Server setup execs. (Too useless tbh)
-Removed redundant cfgs.
-Reorganized the file structure.
-Renamed the files to their proper names.
-Removed Config Settings (Would be a nuisance to go into a file an delete it everytime it gets full.)
-Deleted MVM and General categories entirely (MVM - Unnecessary; infinite time to talk things out. General - Redundant.)
