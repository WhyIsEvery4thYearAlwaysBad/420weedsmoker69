My TF2 config fit for [mastercomfig](https://mastercomfig.com/). It is posted mainly as a back up, but you can download it if you want. 
This config has its own command menu file you use with the C key. To use it you will need to compile 420cmdmenu.txt with the [cmd generator I made](https://github.com/WhyIsEvery4thYearAlwaysBad/CmdMenuGenerator).
