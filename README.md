My TF2 config. Mainly posted this as a back up, but you can download it if you want. Check the advanced options menu, so you won't get confused.
The three branches are specialized for different things:  
* master - Main config.  
* mastercoms (oops I meant mastercomfig but whatever) - For use with mastercomfig.  
* vpk - VPK version of master branch if you are unable to use a vpk compiler.  
Also this has it's own custom voice menu file you use with the C key. To use it you will need to compile 420voicemenu.txt with the [voicemenu generator I have made](https://github.com/WhyIsEvery4thYearAlwaysBad/VoicemenuGenerator).
