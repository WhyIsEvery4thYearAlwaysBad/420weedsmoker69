My TF2 config. Mainly posted this as a back up, but you can download it if you want. NOTE: Please check the advanced options menu! You won't regret it. ;)  
The three branches are specialized for different things:  
  master - Main config.  
  mastercoms (oops I meant mastercomfig but whatever) - For use with mastercomfig.  
  vpk - VPK version of my config if you are unable to use a vpk compiler.  
Also this has it's own custom voice menu file you use with the C key. To use it you will need to compile 420voicemenu.txt with the [voicemenu generator I have made](https://github.com/WhyIsEvery4thYearAlwaysBad/VoicemenuGenerator).
